# Morrowind Modding Notes

#### Compiled by OperatorJack & Morrowind Modding Community

### Introduction

This website presents my notes on various modding topics related to TES III: Morrowind. Most of the notes here a quite advanced and not intended for beginners. Unless otherwise stated, all notes assume an advanced knowledge of the Morrowind Construction Set, intermediate knowledge of MWSE, and working knowledge of the NIF structure and how it works in Morrowind, where applicable.

### Disclaimer

These notes are compiled by me for my personal reference and are provided with **no warranty, gaurentees, explanations, or support. I deny any liability for their usage.** That being said, I have made them public so that, hopefully, they will help modders push Morrowind modding even further.

### Sources

These notes are compiled from my conversations with other modders, their tools, their practices, and my own understanding of Morrowind. Many notes are direct quotes from other modders. I will refrain from citing modders, as many don't want to be pestered about this stuff.

### Contributing

While these are my personal notes, I am very much open to contributions and improvements from other modders. You only need to fork this repository and create a pull request when ready: https://github.com/OperatorJack/mw-modding-notes.
